# Final Project
## 1. Objective
Explore an interesting machine learning problem.
Decide a topic and implement a complete project.

## 2. Submission
- Project proposal
- Poster Presentation: Record a elevator presentation
- Final Report: 4-5 pages
- Source code

## 3. Notes
Presentation may include: objective, background, experimental setup, results, conclusion.


## 4. How to run
`Res/` contains only a small part of the original dataset. The orignal dataset can be found
here:
[CCPD](https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD)

Run the `main.py` would randomly select one picture in the `Src/` and recognize it.  
There is a `cv2.waitkey(0)`, so press space bar after the image shows. 
Segmentation of the images are stored in the `Res/`  

Run `training.py` can run the test KNN_EN and KNN_CN on 8 samples respectively.
